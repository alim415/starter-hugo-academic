Amy Lim is a second year PhD student at Emory University studying Economics. Prior to Emory, she graduated with High Honors from Mount Holyoke College and was a four year member of the varsity swim team. After graduation, she spent three years as a research assistant and eventually an analyst/programmer for Mission Analytics Group (Mission). 

While at Mission, she worked on projects related to: long term care,  child care subsidy pilots, health care, and paid family leave. She worked alongside local, state, and federal agencies such as: California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Office on Women's Health. 

As a researcher, she hopes to better understand the role of government assistance programs and public policy in household decision-making, especially for immigrants, women, and people of color.
